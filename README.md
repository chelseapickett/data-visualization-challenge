The same data was used to create the following types of charts: 
- Bar
- Pie
- Boxplot
- Line

The correlation coefficient was calculated (0.59) and a linear regression model was created for the preferred drug.

When reviewing the data and charts it seems the preferred drug, Capomulin, appears to be a promising treatment.
